# C# RestSharp API Testing Framework

This project is a robust API testing framework built using **C#**, **RestSharp**, and **NUnit**. It is designed to automate the testing of RESTful APIs, ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability. The framework leverages industry-standard tools and practices to provide a comprehensive solution for API testing. Additionally, the `ToSpecFlow` branch transitions this framework into a **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** style using **SpecFlow**, making it more collaborative and human-readable.

## Features

- **RestSharp Integration**: Uses RestSharp, a powerful .NET library for REST API testing, to simplify request creation, response validation, and error handling.
- **NUnit Testing**: Utilizes NUnit as the test runner for robust and scalable test execution.
- **Modular Design**: The framework is structured in a modular way, making it easy to extend and maintain.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Supports data-driven testing using external data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel files.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed test execution reports for better visibility into test results.
- **Environment Configuration**: Easily switch between different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using configuration files.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging for better debugging and traceability.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Ready to be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
- **SpecFlow BDD (ToSpecFlow Branch)**: Transitions the framework into a BDD-style framework using SpecFlow, enabling collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
